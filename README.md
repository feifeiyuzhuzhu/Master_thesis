# Master_thesis
This is the accompanying codes for my master thesis: An integrated approach to incorporating climate uncertainties into urban land-use change modelling.\
The codes connect the MRA Metronamica model with EMA workbench to conduct 2000 experiments by randomly sampling over the uncertain space of the uncertain suitability parameters.\
## How to
* Step 1： * Run_cmd_2050.ipynb: to implement the 2000 experiments by the integration of Metronamica and EMA workbench 
Step 2 Cluster.ipynb: Performances of the different clustering algorithms 
- Cluster.ipynb: Exploration: Analysis of the representative maps
