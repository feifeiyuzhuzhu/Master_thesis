# Master_thesis
This is the accompanying codes for the master thesis: An integrated approach to incorporating climate uncertainties into urban land-use change modelling.\
The codes connect the MRA Metronamica model with EMA workbench to conduct 2000 experiments by randomly sampling over the uncertain space of the flooding suitability parameters.
## How to
* Step 1:  Run_cmd_2050.ipynb: to implement the 2000 experiments by the integration of Metronamica and EMA workbench 
* Step 2:  Run Cluster.ipynb: to see the performances of the different clustering algorithms 
* Step 3:  Run Cluster Exploration.ipynb: to check the analysis of the representative maps
