# Master_thesis
This is the accompanying codes for the master thesis: An integrated approach to incorporating climate uncertainties into urban land-use change modelling.\
The codes connect the MRA Metronamica model with EMA workbench to conduct 2000 experiments by randomly sampling over the uncertain space of the flooding suitability parameters.
## How to
If you want to reproduce the experiments and analysis, please put all the provided data under one same folder. 
* Step 1: Go to " Run_cmd_2050.ipynb": to implement the 2000 experiments by the integration of Metronamica and EMA workbench 
* Step 2:  Go to " Cluster.ipynb": to see the performances of the different clustering algorithms 
* Step 3:  Go to " Run Cluster Exploration.ipynb": to check the analysis of the representative maps
