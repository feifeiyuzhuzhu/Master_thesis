# Master_thesis
This is the accompanying codes for my master thesis: An integrated approach to incorporating climate uncertainties into urban land-use change modelling.\
The codes connect the MRA Metronamica model with EMA workbench to conduct 2000 experiments by randomly sampling over the uncertain space of the uncertain suitability parameters.\
